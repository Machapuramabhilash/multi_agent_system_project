## Features
- **Data Loading**: Load and analyze datasets using the `ResearchAgent`.
- **Use Case Generation**: Generate relevant AI use cases with the `UseGenerationAgent`.
- **Logging and Error Handling**: Basic logging to help track execution flow and handle errors.

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd your_project
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate

   # Linux or macOS
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
